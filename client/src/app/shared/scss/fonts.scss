// Define the specific fonts and font styling to be used by each element type
// fonts might not be the best name for that then? 

// Actually I should just store the fonts in here so if I have to use a ttf it
// can all be done from here and then all I have to do is import the font
// what I said above should probably be done elsewhere in another files that
// meshes this file and themes together to come up with a standardized stylng for
// each element type, or at least class names that I expect to need

// Can probably just do this component by component to avoid taking on too much at once
// then finish off with a final cleanup
